# React Example Starter Project

This is a basic React example starter project that can be used as a template to kickstart your React applications. It includes a simple React component structure and demonstrates the usage of props and mapping data from an array.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

```
- src
  - index.js
- styles.css
- README.md
- package.json
- ...
```

- `src/index.js`: Entry point of the application.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the components.
- `README.md`: Markdown file providing information about the project.
- `package.json`: Contains project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd react-example-starter-project`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm start`: Starts the development server.
- `npm build`: Builds the production-ready optimized version of the project.
- `npm test`: Runs the tests.
- `npm eject`: Ejects the project from react-scripts and gives full control over configurations.

Make sure to run these commands in the project directory.

## Usage

The `App` component in `src/index.js` is the main component that renders the entire application. It includes a `SkillList` component, which maps over the `skills` array and renders a `Skill` component for each skill item.

The `Skill` component takes in `skill`, `level`, and `color` as props and displays the skill name, level emoji, and background color accordingly.

The `Avatar` and `Intro` components display an avatar image and introductory text, respectively.

Feel free to modify or extend the components and styles to suit your project requirements.

## Skills Data

The skills data used in this example can be found in the `src/index.js` file. You can modify the `skills` array to add or remove skills and customize their levels and colors.
